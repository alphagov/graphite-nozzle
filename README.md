# graphite-nozzle

This library consumes events off the Cloud Foundry Firehose, processes them, and then sends them off to a StatsD endpoint. Note that it is still being developed and shouldn't be considered production-ready.

## Getting Started

* A user who has access to the Cloud Foundry Firehose configured in
your manifest

```
properties:
  uaa:
    clients:
      graphite-nozzle:
        access-token-validity: 1209600
        authorized-grant-types: authorization_code,client_credentials,refresh_token
        override: true
        secret: <password>
        scope: openid,oauth.approvals,doppler.firehose
        authorities: oauth.login,doppler.firehose

```

* A Graphite and StatsD server (see [here](https://github.com/CloudCredo/graphite-statsd-boshrelease) for a Graphite/StatsD BOSH release).
* Golang installed and configured (see [here](https://golang.org/doc/install) for a tutorial on how to do this).
* godep (see [here](https://github.com/tools/godep) for installation instructions).

Once you've met all the prerequisites, you'll need to download the library and install the dependencies:

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/pivotal-cf
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pivotal-cf
git clone git@github.com:pivotal-cf/graphite-nozzle.git
cd graphite-nozzle
godep restore
godep go build
```

Finally, run the app:

```
./graphite-nozzle --help
```

## Metrics Overview

Following is a brief overview of the metrics that graphite-nozzle will extract from the Firehose and send off to Graphite.

### CounterEvent

CounterEvents represent the increment of a counter. graphite-nozzle will send these through to StatsD as a Counter metric. These metrics appear in the Graphite Web UI under `Graphite.stats.counters.<statsdPrefix>.ops.<counterName>`.

### ContainerMetric

CPU, RAM and disk usage metrics for app containers will be sent through to StatsD as a Gauge metric. Note that ContainerMetric Events will not appear on the Firehose by default (at the moment) so you'll need to run a separate app to generate these. There is a sample ContainerMetric-generating app included in the noaa repository [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/noaa/tree/master/container_metrics_sample). These metrics appear in the Graphite Web UI under `Graphite.stats.gauges.<statsdPrefix>.apps.<appID>.<containerMetric>.<instanceIndex>`.

### Heartbeat

Heartbeat Events indicate liveness of the emitter and provide counts of the number of Events processed by the emitter. These metrics get sent through to StatsD as Gauge metrics. graphite-nozzle also increments a Counter metric for each component whenever a Heartbeat Event is received. These metrics appear in the Graphite Web UI under `Graphite.stats.gauges.<statsdPrefix>.ops.<Origin>.heartbeats.*`.

### HTTPStartStop

HTTP requests passing through the Cloud Foundry routers get recorded as HTTPStartStop Events. graphite-nozzle takes these events and extracts useful information, such as the response time and status code. These metrics are then sent through to StatsD. The following table gives an overview of the HTTP metrics graphite-nozzle handles:

| Name | Description | StatsD Metric Type |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| HttpStartStopResponseTime | HTTP response times in milliseconds | Timer |
| HttpStartStopStatusCodeCount | A count of each HTTP status code | Counter |


For all HTTPStartStop Events, the hostname is extracted from the URI and used in the Metric name. `.` characters are also replaced with `_` characters. This means that, for example, HTTP requests to `http://api.mycf.com/v2/info` will be recorded under `http://api_mycf_com` in the Graphite web UI. This is to avoid polluting the UI with hundreds of endpoints.

Also note that 2 HTTPStartStop Events are generated per HTTP request to an application running in Cloud Foundry. graphite-nozzle will only increment the StatusCode counter for the HttpStartStop Events where `PeerType` == `PeerType_Client`. This is in order to accurately graph the incoming HTTP requests.

### ValueMetric

Any ValueMetric Event that appears on the Firehose will be sent through to StatsD as a Gauge metric. This includes metrics such as numCPUS, numGoRoutines, memoryStats, etc. These metrics appear in the Graphite web UI under `Graphite.stats.gauges.<statsdPrefix>.ops.<Origin>`.

## Testing

To run the test suite, first make sure you have ginkgo and gomega installed:

```
go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
go get github.com/onsi/gomega
```

Then run `ginkgo -r` from root of this repository.
